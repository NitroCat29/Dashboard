# Simple 3D Game Playground

This project is a starting point for creating simple 3D games in the browser using only HTML and CDN packages like [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [cannon-es](https://pmnd.rs/cannon-es/).  
No build tools or frameworks required—just open `index.html` in your browser!

## Features

- **3D Graphics**: Powered by [three.js](https://threejs.org/) via CDN.
- **Physics Simulation**: Realistic movement and collisions using [cannon-es](https://pmnd.rs/cannon-es/).
- **Keyboard Controls**: Move your player (a cube, like a simple car) with arrow keys or WASD.
- **Collectibles & Obstacles**: Pick up items and avoid obstacles.
- **Easy to Extend**: Use this as a template for your own 3D browser games.

## Controls

- **Arrow keys / WASD**: Move the player (cube/car) around.
- **Space**: Jump.

## How to Use

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**
3. **Play the game!**  
   Move the cube, collect yellow spheres, and avoid purple obstacles.

## How It Works

- All logic is in a single HTML file.
- 3D scene and physics are set up using CDN scripts.
- You can easily modify the code to create your own 3D games—change the player model, add new objects, or tweak the controls.

## Customization Ideas

- Replace the cube with a car model.
- Add more collectibles or different types of obstacles.
- Change the controls for different gameplay styles.
